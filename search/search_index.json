When an autonomous agent initiates a payment, this core assumption is broken, leading to critical questions that current systems cannot answer:</p> <ul> <li>Authorization: How can we verify that a user gave an agent specific     authority for a particular purchase?</li> <li>Authenticity: How can a merchant be sure an agent's request accurately     reflects the user's true intent, without errors or AI \"hallucinations\"?</li> <li>Accountability: If a fraudulent or incorrect transaction occurs, who is     accountable\u2014the user, the agent's developer, the merchant, or the issuer?</li> </ul> <p>This ambiguity creates a crisis of trust that could significantly limit adoption.

It   provides a secure, auditable foundation whether an agent is using a credit   card or transacting with stablecoins. This flexible design allows us to   extend its core principles to new ecosystems, ensuring a consistent   standard for trust everywhere.</p> <p>As a first step, check out google-agentic-commerce/a2a-x402 which is an implementation of A2A in conjunction with the x402 standard.

It   protects sensitive user information, such as conversational prompts and   personal payment details, by preventing shopping agents from accessing   sensitive PCI or PII data through payload encryption and a role-based   architecture.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>How does AP2 address transaction accountability?</p> <ul> <li>A primary objective is to provide supporting evidence that helps payment   networks establish accountability and liability principles. In a dispute,   the network adjudicator (e.g., Card Network) can use the user-signed   cart mandate and compare the details of what was agreed upon between the   agent and the consumer against the details in the dispute to help   determine transaction accountability.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What prevents an agent from \"hallucinating\" and making an incorrect purchase?</p> <ul> <li>The principle of Verifiable Intent, Not Inferred Action addresses this   risk. Transactions must be anchored to deterministic, non-repudiable proof   of intent from all parties, such as the user-signed Cart or Intent   Mandate, rather than relying only on interpreting the probabilistic and   ambiguous outputs of a language model.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why was crypto and Web3 support included from day one?</p> <ul> <li>Supporting a broad range of payment types, including digital payment   methods ensures the protocol is future-proof.

Agent2Agent Protocol A2A An open standard for secure, collaborative communication and task management between diverse AI agents, regardless of their underlying frameworks. Context: AP2 can be implemented as an extension of A2A to facilitate financial transactions, with a focus on high-trust agentic payments. Agentic payments Payment flows in which autonomous AI Agents are involved. Credentials Provider CP A secure entity, like a digital wallet, responsible for managing and executing the user's payment and identity credentials. Deterministic cryptographical proof A unique mathematical proof that could be linked to a hardware device. Dynamic Linking A core requirement for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), involving the inclusion of specific transaction details within a Payment Credential to link the SCA to that transaction. Context: Ensures the payer explicitly consents to transaction details like amount and payee. Merchant Endpoint (Or Remote Endpoint) ME, RE The web interface or AI agent representing the seller, showcasing products and negotiating the cart. Merchant Payment Processor Endpoint MPP The entity responsible for constructing and sending the transaction authorization message to the payment ecosystem. Model Context Protocol MCP A protocol standardizing how AI models and agents connect to and interact with external resources like tools, APIs, and data sources. Payee A person or entity who is the intended recipient of funds from a payment transaction. Context: Can request attestations along with payment confirmation. Merchant, Creditor Name Payer A person or entity who holds a payment account, allows a payment order from that account. Context: Initiates payment orders. User, Holder Payment Agent A proposed key role in agent payments responsible for selecting the ideal payment method, validating payment details, and handling errors. Context: A Payment Agent is not a necessary requirement to participate in the protocol. MCP-based endpoints can also play similar roles. Payment Contracts \"Mandates\" or \"Payment Contracts\" that capture a user's specific instructions to their agent. Context: Define principles for safe, secure, and high-trust agentic payments. They can be global or transaction-level. Mandates, Shopping Mandate Payment Credential A credential or instrument (or reference to one) which can be charged towards a payment. Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAA), Payment Wallet Attestation (PWA), Digital Payment Credentials (DPC), Payment Means Attestation, SPC Credential Payment Request API (W3C Standard) A web API that acts as an intermediary between a merchant, user, and payment method provider to streamline the payment experience. Strong Customer Authentication SCA A process required by regulatory frameworks for online identification and transaction initiation in financial services. Context: Central to the Payments Rulebook, ensuring security and dynamic linking of transactions. Strong User Authentication, Integrated SCA User The human initiating the task and providing financial authority. User Agent a.k.a. Shopping Agent UA, SA The AI surface interacts directly with the user, understanding their needs, and coordinating the purchase. Verifiable digital credential VDC An Issuer-signed credential (i.e., a set of Claims) whose authenticity can be verified.

This is    signed by the user and shared with the Merchant so they can decide if they    are able to fulfill the user\u2019s requirement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merchant can force user confirmation: If the Merchant is unsure about their    ability to fulfill the user\u2019s needs (e.g. the request is not for a specific SKU), they can force the user to come back    into session to confirm. Here, the merchant can require either (i) the user    select from among a set of SKUs presented to them or (ii) provide answers to    additional questions that the merchant needs to know. (i) can lead to    creation of Human-Present cart mandate and (ii) can lead to updating the    \u201cintent mandate\u201d with more information. This ensures that the Merchants get    more confidence on the user\u2019s intent if they are unsure. With (i), merchants now get confirmation of the user having reviewed the purchases leading to the accountability of a bad transaction leaning towards the user. Merchants may    balance transaction conversion rates with returns/user dissatisfaction to    decide when they want to force users to provide additional confirmation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Example Scenario</p> <ul> <li>User says to SA: \"Buy 2 tickets to \\&lt;this concert&gt; from \\&lt;this     merchant&gt; as soon as they become available for the Vegas show in July.     Your budget is $1000 and we\u2019d like to be as close to the main stage as     possible\"</li> <li>User signs this as an Intent Mandate allowing the SA to purchase in the     user\u2019s absence.</li> <li>Merchant receives this intent mandate and then they can say \"I have 3     variations of seating which fulfill this criteria and I don\u2019t know which one     the user wants. The intent mandate is not sufficient for me to fulfill this     order\".</li> <li>The merchant can respond to the SA and say that I want to show the user the     final 3 options.</li> <li>SA notifies the user that their presence is needed before the txn can be     initiated. User sees the 3 options, picks one and can now sign a \"Cart     Mandate\" which gives the merchant evidence that the user knows exactly what     they are getting, and also shifts accountability of a bad transaction towards the user unless there is clear merchant error (for example, mis-ship or damaged items)</li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, the merchant may have decided to fulfill the order with the cheapest tickets which meet the criteria.

Mispick, Unapproved by User The Shopping Agent autonomously purchases an item that violates the user's signed Intent Mandate (e.g., exceeds budget or is the wrong item).

Verifiable digital credential VDC An Issuer-signed credential (i.e., a set of Claims) whose authenticity can be verified. Typically bound to a cryptographic key and used in the issuer-holder-verifier model. Digital Credential, Verifiable Credential Verifiable presentation VP A presentation of one or more VDCs that includes a cryptographic proof of holder binding, created in response to a request from a Verifier. Allows a Verifier to confirm that the Holder intended the presentation for them and may reveal only a subset of claims. <p>Copyright 2025 Google LLC.
